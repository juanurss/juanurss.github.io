            The last <b>27</b>,<b>28</b> and <b>29</b> of September was the <a href="https://www.ekoparty.org/"> ekoparty security confence</a>,in this conference I did a workshop focused on mobile application implementations. And I talked about some security examples and implementations where thoose examples were based on differents mobile penetration test what I did.</p>
        <p>
            Where I showed some "bad implementations" inside the code, hardcoded issues like usernames, passwords, services (FTP, SFTP, etc) or the lack of binary protections like obfuscation, anti-emulation, root checker, bad implementations of certificate pinning, SSL/TLS, etc.</p>
